Travelling for me does not mean just visiting places or ticking boxes from the bucket list, but understanding people of different cultures, backgrounds and expanding horizons in a pursue to become at least slightly less narrow-minded. :-)

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/myVisitedPlaces.gif" title="My visited places" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    An interactive animated map of the places I visited - never been to the South Hemisphere so far!
</div>

If I feel like it (read if I prioritize this enough), I may eventually publish some blogposts or pictures from my travels.
