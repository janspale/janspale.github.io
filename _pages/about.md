My name is Jan Å pale and I am a Researcher in Energy systems for industrial buildings at [University Center for Energy Efficient Buildings](https://www.uceeb.cz/en/ing-jan-spale-en/), CTU in Prague and a PhD Candidate in Energy systems at [Faculty of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.fs.cvut.cz/en/home/), CTU in Prague.

My research focus is distributed energy systems, high temperature heat pumps, combined heat and power, waste heat recovery and industrial process heat supply. If you are interested in any of that, feel free to check out the [publications](https://janspale.github.io/publications/) subpage or eventually contact me for future collaboration!

Currently a Fulbright Visiting Researcher at Purdue University, [Ray W. Herrick Laboratories](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Herrick), pursuing to develop industrial high temperature heat pumps within the team of Thermal Systems and High Performance Buildings under supervision of [Prof. Davide Ziviani](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=164622).
