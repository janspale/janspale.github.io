My name is Jan Špale and I am a Research group leader in Industrial Thermal Energy Systems (INTENS) at [University Center for Energy Efficient Buildings](https://www.uceeb.cz/en/intens-en/), CTU in Prague and an Assistant Professor in Energy systems at [Faculty of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.fs.cvut.cz/en/home/), CTU in Prague.

My research focus is industrial scale distributed energy systems, focusing on high temperature heat pumps, high temperature thermal energy storage, combined heat and power systems and waste heat recovery. If you are interested in any of that, feel free to check out the [publications](https://janspale.github.io/publications/) subpage or eventually contact me for future collaboration!

I am a Fulbright Alumnus (2023/2024) of Fulbright-Masaryk Scholarship program which helped me to spend a wonderful year at Purdue University, [Ray W. Herrick Laboratories](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Herrick), where I pursued to develop industrial high temperature heat pumps within the team of Thermal Systems and High Performance Buildings under supervision of [Prof. Davide Ziviani](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=164622) and [Dr. Ian Bell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNn0e_4AAAAJ&hl=en).
